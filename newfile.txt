Answer to the difference between add, commit, and, push:

 Using git add, you are adding your newly updated file/s to the staging area which will
be committed in the future. With git commit, you are locking in your modified files
to your local repository. This means your changes cannot be accessed by the other peers yet.
With git push, you are syncing your committed files to the online repository. The files you
have pushed can now be accessed by your peers through git pull.
